- reviewed material from Self-Hosting Docker course (udemy.com/course/self-hosting-docker-linux) to prepare to host another app on my own
- attempting to deploy Time Tagger (https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger) --> deploy successful
- used Bcrypt from previously deployed IT Tools to hash a password - I'm finding them more and more useful
- figuring out where Docker/Portainer actually stores things on the system, but it seems more complex than anticipated, and I don't think I can grasp this just yet

## 2025-10-20 MON
- signed up for an extensive live course for DevOps - not necessarily because I can't learn myself, but to have an explicit reason why I can't go out or fool around (my boundary-setting skill is still under development T^T)
- for the course, I have to install CentOS, and after considering my options, available hardware, and convenience, I decided to have a virtual machine on a MacBook
- went through the hurdle of downloading VMware Fusion for Mac from the Broadcom website (the user experience was truly terrible)
- got an error worthy of a dummy I am: "This VM cannot be powered on because it requires x86 machine architecture, which is incompatible with this ARM machine architecture host" - redownloading a correct ISO
- CentOS installed in a VM through VMware Fusion and running correctly

## 2025-10-21 TUE
- going through various escape characters for the `echo` command. The most interesting one so far is \r - "carriage return". I didn't know there was a backspace \b either. Learned how to do math directly in terminal: `echo $((10 - 4))`
- the tutorial I bought is perfect: full of mistakes and it's making me double-check everything the tutor is talking about. This is exactly what I needed - believe no one, try and check yourself, lol.
- `id` output: user id, primary group, supplementary groups
- to check all groups, read /etc/groups
