## 2025-10-18 SAT
- reviewed material from Self-Hosting Docker course (udemy.com/course/self-hosting-docker-linux) to prepare to host another app on my own
- attempting to deploy Time Tagger (https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger) --> deploy successful
- used Bcrypt from previously deployed IT Tools to hash a password - I'm finding them more and more useful
- figuring out where Docker/Portainer actually stores things on the system, but it seems more complex than anticipated, and I don't think I can grasp this just yet

## 2025-10-20 MON
- signed up for an extensive live course for DevOps - not necessarily because I can't learn myself, but to have an explicit reason why I can't go out or fool around (my boundary-setting skill is still under development T^T)
- for the course, I have to install CentOS, and after considering my options, available hardware, and convenience, I decided to have a virtual machine on a MacBook
- went through the hurdle of downloading VMware Fusion for Mac from the Broadcom website (the user experience was truly terrible)
- got an error worthy of a dummy I am: "This VM cannot be powered on because it requires x86 machine architecture, which is incompatible with this ARM machine architecture host" - redownloading a correct ISO
- CentOS installed in a VM through VMware Fusion and running correctly

## 2025-10-21 TUE
- going through various escape characters for the `echo` command. The most interesting one so far is \r - "carriage return". I didn't know there was a backspace \b either. Learned how to do math directly in terminal: `echo $((10 - 4))`
- the tutorial I bought is perfect: full of mistakes and it's making me double-check everything the tutor is talking about. This is exactly what I needed - believe no one, try and check yourself, lol.
- `id` output: user id, primary group, supplementary groups
- to check all groups, read /etc/groups

## 2025-10-23 THU | Mood 2/10 but it is what it is
- practiced `cp` and `mv` commands with various options. I found `mv -i` quite practical to prevent accidental overwrite, also `cp -n` to only copy without overwriting repeated files. Examined man pages. 

## 2025-10-24 FRI
- learned that the `touch` command will not overwrite a pre-existing file - it will only change the file's access and modification times, and this is its main function (not to create new files).
- practiced `mkdir`, `rmdir`, and `rm` commands. Again, flag `-i` is proving useful.

## 2025-10-25 SAT
-  went through the orientation call for a Geeks4Geeks DevOps course. I got up at 7:25 AM my time on Saturday to join, and I didn't have to force myself out of bed, even though I'm sleep deprived. It's exciting. The live course itself also looks really promising.
- reviewed head and tail commands for text stream processing

## 2025-10-26 SUN
- learned about `tac` command, which prints the content of the file just like the `cat` command, but bottom-up - last line first
- I need to switch to using `less` and `more` commands more often since they have added functionality. But I can also open everything in Vim

## 2025-10-27 MON
- played with the `cut` command. I understand now how we can define the delimiter with `-d` option and display only certain fields in certain positions of the text file (add `-f <num>`). Option `-w` by default defines delimiter as whitespaces (spaces and tabs) and can be an alternative to `-d " "`
- exercised various `grep` options and found a few cool ones, like `-A2 -B2` returns the search result and 2 lines before it and 2 lines after it. Probably my most used option will be `-i` since it makes the search case insensitive. I recognize that I need to learn regular expressions to use the full potential of `grep`.

## 2025-10-28 TUE
- Learned `sort` and `comm` commands and how to combine them. Discovered that it’s not possible to compare two `sort` outputs directly inline (e.g., `comm (sort ...) (sort ...)`) because `comm` expects files. The workaround is process substitution, which lets the shell treat command output as a file: `comm <(sort ...) <(sort ...)`. Neat.
- Noted that many commands use different option letters for similar things (e.g., the delimiter flag `-t ' '`), which can be confusing. I’ll need repetition to get used to it.
- Practiced `sed` and `tee` for text processing and combining them in pipelines, then using `comm` to compare results. Learned that on Linux `sed -i` edits files in place directly, while on macOS it requires `sed -i ''` (or a suffix like `.bak`) to work without errors.

## 2025-10-30 THU
- very busy with holiday preparations but practiced tr, uniq, and wc in a spare moment. Super proud that I showed up.

## 2025-10-31 FRI
- refreshed knowledge of `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` commands
- reviewed the difference between `gzip` (compresses a single file) and `tar` (bundles multiple files, with optional compression)
- learned that `tar -czvf` creates a compressed `.tar.gz` archive directly (using gzip), while `tar -cjvf` uses bzip2 for stronger but slower compression

## 2025-11-01 SAT
- had my first live class with the DevOps training group. Learned how virtualization lets several systems share one physical machine. It helped me understand how servers can run many isolated environments at the same time and why this is important for efficient use of hardware.  
- practiced Linux environment variables. Used `export` to create a variable, `unset` to remove it, and added it to `~/.bashrc` to make it permanent. Learned that variables created with `export` only last for one session unless saved in a config file.  
- compared `printenv` and `env`. Learned that both show environment variables, but `env` can also run commands with temporary variable values.  
- created and ran a simple shell script to display some environment variables. Learned that a script can only access variables that were exported, which helped me understand how environment inheritance works between a shell and its child processes.  

## 2025-11-02 SUN
- practiced regex patterns through https://regexlearn.com/learn/regex101 - it was alright but for some reason the last lessons had no practice part. I will try https://regexone.com/ next, then https://scrimba.com/learn-regular-expressions-c0d. One can never have enough practice. I don't think having a regex cheat sheet is ever enough.

## 2025-11-04 TUE
- continued regex practice with https://regexone.com/ as planned. Repetition really makes perfect.

## 2025-11-05 WED
- am I a regex pro or what? It all makes sense now. I can easily use it with `grep -E` or `sed -E` now.
- refreshed memory of basic Linux user CRUD commands: id, useradd, usermod, userdel, groups, groupadd, passwd
- unexpected lessons: (1/2) `whoami` prints who you are, `sudo whoami` prints who you become when using `sudo`; (2/2) To add user to sudoers on Ubuntu/Debian execute `sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>` and on RedHat/CentOS/Fedora `sudo usermod -aG wheel <username>` - optionally do it through `visudo`

## 2025-11-06 THU
- studied how the Linux terminal, shell, and kernel interact. Finally understood something that confused me years ago. Back in 2016, when I worked in support for a Linux-based application, I used to tell users to run installation scripts with bash <filename>.sh. The developers insisted on using ./<filename>.sh, but they couldn’t really explain why (I suspect they were interns). Now it’s clear: running a script with bash forces it to execute in the Bash shell, while ./<filename>.sh runs it using the shell specified in the script’s first line — the shebang (#!/bin/bash, for example). This makes scripts portable across systems with different default shells.
- wrote a simple shell script with variables, arithmetic operations, and user input to get a feel for the syntax. Bash scripting feels surprisingly natural. Hope it’s not my famous final words.

## 2025-11-09 SUN
- learned how to run commands in the background by adding `&` at the end — useful when a process might take a while but you still want to keep working (e.g., `sleep 500 &`). You can view all background jobs with `jobs`.
- discovered how to bring a process back to the foreground using `fg <jobID>` or send it back to the background with `bg <jobID>`. They’ll still stop once the terminal window is closed, though — so no sneaky long runs after you log out.
- explored various options in the `top` command to get familiar with its interface and understand system resource usage in real time.
