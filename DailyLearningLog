- reviewed material from Self-Hosting Docker course (udemy.com/course/self-hosting-docker-linux) to prepare to host another app on my own
- attempting to deploy Time Tagger (https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger) --> deploy successful
- used Bcrypt from previously deployed IT Tools to hash a password - I'm finding them more and more useful
- figuring out where docker/portainer actually stores things on the system, but it seems more complex than anticipated, and I don't think I can grasp this just yet
